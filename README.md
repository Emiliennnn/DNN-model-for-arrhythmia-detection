This project was lead in 2023 as a final project assignment for the TU Delft course
EE4C12 - Machine Learning for Electrical Engineering (https://microelectronics.tudelft.nl/Education/coursedetail.php?mi=179),
in team with Cyprien Tordo.

In this Final Project Assignment, our goal is to develop a Machine Learning model to detect various
types of abnormal heartbeats (arrhythmias) from heart activity recorded in the form of an
electrocardiogram (ECG).

In concrete terms, we have a total of 109451 ECG samples. Each ECG sample is an ordered list of 250
numerical values, and is labeled with a specific type of arrhythmia.

In our application, there are 15 different types of arrhythmia, holding labels 0 to 14.
In practice, the aim of this project is to predict the arrhythmia type to which an ECG sample belongs,
based only on the 250 sample values.

As the role of this project is to put into practice all the theory assimilated during the quarter, we
chose ECG sample classification as our subject, since the medical field seemed to us to be a very good
concrete example of how Machine Learning can be put to good use.


The report presents our intellectual path and the methods we developed to achieve it, and describes
the steps we took to orchestrate the whole project.
